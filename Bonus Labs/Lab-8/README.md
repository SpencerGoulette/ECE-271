What is your something cool?
-------
1. Using different joystick controls, different things happwn with the LEDs and the LCD.

Post-lab Questions
-------
1. If the interrupt handler flags were not cleared, it does not work. It doesn't work because since the flag isn't cleared, it is constantly busy and keeps running through the interrupt.
2. Software is unable to set the interrupt flag bit, but it can set a different bit that will make the hardware set the interrupt flag bit. So, in a way, software can set the flag by setting another bit which makes hardware set the flag.
