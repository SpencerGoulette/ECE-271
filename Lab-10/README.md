Summary of Lab Status
-------
- [X] Pre-lab Assignment (2 points) 
- [X] Basic in-lab assignments (15 points) 
- [X] Something cool (3 points): 

What is your something cool?
-------
1. You can enter the degrees you want the stepper motor to rotate using the keypad and pressing '#' when you are done.

Post-lab Questions
-------
1. In order to get a current voltage higher than the Darlington Array's 500mA current, you need to put currents in parallel so they meet up at a junction and add up to be more than the 500mA.
2. It is possible to do microstepping. They way you do it is by applying different voltages to the 4 inputs, which will allow you to rotate it 1/4 or an 1/8 of a step for each input pulse.
